   <h2>Project Description</h2>
   <p><ul><li> The Trial Project is a practice project that showcases skills in Git, GitHub, and web development. The goal is to create a new repository on GitHub, follow Git's best practices, and document the work professionally. Key steps include adding a file that ignores certain files, setting up a code quality checker, and creating a clear README file. Additionally, three files are added: an HTML file with a header, a CSS file with styles, and a test.md file that is intentionally ignored by Git. The project emphasizes proper version control and well-structured project management.</li></ul></p>
